# Summary
For this lab, the overall goal is to learn the important tools of Soldering and Reverse Engineering. Soldering is a technique of sorts that "welds" or puts things together permanently. There are several way to do so and the purpose of this lab was for us to learn those ways. The lab also has us take apart a robot completely and put it back together, specifically a Redbot with shadow chassis with parts from sparkfun. This can be described as Reverse Engineering, beacuse by seeing the internal parts of the robot, its' function, design, and specificity is revealed, giving the observer the keys to how it works.

# Assembly Procedures

# Test Equipment
The only test equipment that was used in our lab was a black line of tape as well as the arduino program that was used to test the robot sensors that follow the black line of tape for movement.
