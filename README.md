# BAE305 Lab 2 - Soldering and Reverse Engineering
# By: Spencer Givan
# Summary
For this lab, the overall goal is to learn the important tools of Soldering and Reverse Engineering. Soldering is a technique of sorts that "welds" or puts things together permanently. There are several way to do so and the purpose of this lab was for us to learn those ways. The lab also has us take apart a robot completely and put it back together, specifically a Redbot with shadow chassis with parts from sparkfun. This can be described as Reverse Engineering, beacuse by seeing the internal parts of the robot, its' function, design, and specificity is revealed, giving the observer the keys to how it works.
# Materials
For Soldering, the materials are as followed.
- Soldering Iron
- Stand for Soldering Iron
- Wet Paper Towel
- Power Source
- Lead to solder with

- PRT-12002, Breadboard (Self-Adhesive, White)
- ROB-14450, Sparkfun Motor Driver - Dual TB6612FNG (with headers)
- SEN-11769, Sparkfun Redbot Sensor - Line Follower (2 of them)
- DEV-13975, Sparkfun RedBoard - Programmed with Arduino
- Jumper Wires
- Front Motor Mount (C)
- Rear Motor Mount (D)
- Motor (K)
- Line Follower Mount (I)
- Line Follower Mount PLate (J)

- Battery Holder (Z)
- 4 AA Batteries

# Assembly Procedures
Part 1- Learning how to Solder

i. Tinning

- Watch the provided video on an introduction to soldering, and after assemble the soldering iron provided, following the given instructions.
-	Wrap the tip of the soldering iron in solder.
- Place the soldering iron on the stand so that it lays flat. Place a wet paper towel under the tip to catch any solder that falls from the tip. 
- Then, turn on the iron and wait for it to heat up. 
- Once the soldering iron is hot the solder will begin to melt. Once it has all melted and fallen off, inspect the tip of the soldering iron to ensure it has been properly tinned. A properly tinned soldering iron will have a shiny silver coating. 

ii. Soldering

I.	Practice soldering the scrap wires into the protoboards provided.
II.	Solder resistor/capacitor on the protoboard.
III.	Solder one wire or component into adjacent holes in the circuit board.
IV.	Solder another wire or component in the two holes directly above or below the previous wire or component.
V.	Solder three components/wires side by side in a row. For a total of six solder joints.
VI.	Verify solder joints with TA.
VII.	Solder the header pins onto the stick power supply.
VIII.	Verify soldering with TA.


# Test Equipment
The only test equipment that was used in our lab was a black line of tape as well as the arduino program that was used to test the robot sensors that follow the black line of tape for movement.
